Alaman agent simulation

## Overview

Alaman simulates **agents** acting in a **universe**. It consists of:

* A **universe** consisting of a map populated by **objects** and **agents**
* An **admin** that manages and directs agents by issuing **commands**
* **agents** which perform **commands** and collect data in the form of **events**
* **devices** which collect data and perform tasks on behalf of **agents**

An admin UI allows administrators manage the simulation.
The simulation can run in discrete time steps or real time.

### Devices

* **camera** - collects images
* **gps** - collects location and movement
* **hygrometer** - collects humidity readings
* **thermometer** - collects temperature
