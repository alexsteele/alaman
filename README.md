Alaman agent simulation

## Overview

Alaman simulates **agents** acting in a **universe**. It consists of:

* A **universe** consisting of a map populated by **objects** and **agents**
* An **admin** that manages and directs agents by issuing **commands**
* **agents** which perform commands and collect data in the form of **events**
* **devices** which collect data and perform tasks on behalf of agents

An admin UI allows administrators manage the simulation.
The simulation can run in discrete time steps or real time.

### Devices

* **camera** - collects images
* **gps** - collects location and movement
* **hygrometer** - collects humidity readings
* **thermometer** - collects temperature
* **thruster** - engine controlling agent movement

## Usage

## Installation

## Ideas

Some other ideas for this project:

* Simulate activity in the real world with OpenStreetMap data
* Antagonistic and chaotic agent types
* Collect feeds of event data from agents
* Allow admins to submit goals which are translated into plans executed by agents
